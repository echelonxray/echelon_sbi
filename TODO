TODO: 
--Clean Up typing for portability across XLEN sizes
--Implement format string outputs: printf, dprintf, sprintf, etc...
--s_delegation_trampoline Does not work because it interrupts supervisor execution without 
  regard to whether S-Mode is ready to service an interrupt.  It needs to be reworked so that 
  it only fires when supervisor mode can accept interrupts and it's fireing needs to be 
  deferred until then.
--Remove the C handler for core initialization.  It is simple enough to do more cleanly in 
  just assembly.
--Use send_hart_command() to Setup the Hart for initial entry to supervisor mode
--Implement granular sfence.vma and granular remote sfence.vma
--Implement hypervisor support and hypervisor remove memory fences
--Make memory and hart id validation more flexible and robust
--General clean up
--Remove context id parameter in the c interrupt handler because it is not needed.  
  It's name is also confusing.  It stores the same information as the TLS global mhartid.
